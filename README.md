# SHAPES
Codes for the SHAPES (Swarm Heuristics based Adaptive and Penalized
 Estimation of Splines) adaptive spline curve fitting method described in:
 
Soumya D. Mohanty and Ethan Fahnestock. "Adaptive spline fitting with particle swarm optimization." arXiv preprint [arXiv:1907.12160](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12160) (2019).

This repository is **under construction**. Please contact the first author of the paper if you would like to use the codes before this repository is completed.

# INSTALLATION
- Clone the repository containing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) codes: [SDMBIGDAT19](https://github.com/mohanty-sd/SDMBIGDAT19.git)
- Edit the [pathset.m](./pathset.m) file in SHAPES to provide the path to the SDMBIGDAT19 directory in your local directory tree.

# Notes
- The terms **breakpoints** and **knots** are used interchangeably in the codes and the documentation. 
We have tried to alleviate this overlap as much as possible but isolated instances may occur.
- The terms **benchmark function** and **benchmark signal** also appear interchangeably.

# TODOs:

- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Test suite
- [x] Add data generation codes
- [ ] Add standalone PSO codes
- [x] Add B-spline generation codes
- [x] Add SHAPES codes
