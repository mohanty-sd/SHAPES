# SHAPES
Codes for the SHAPES (Swarm Heuristics based Adaptive and Penalized
 Estimation of Splines) adaptive spline curve fitting method described in:
 
Soumya D. Mohanty and Ethan Fahnestock. "Adaptive spline fitting with particle swarm optimization." arXiv preprint [arXiv:1907.12160](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12160) (2019).

This repository is under construction. Please contact the first author of the paper if you would like to use the codes before this repository is completed.

TODOs:

-[] Add data generation codes
-[] Add standalone PSO codes
-[] Add B-spline generation codes
-[] Add SHAPES codes
